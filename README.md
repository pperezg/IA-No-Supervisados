# AI Class: Unsupervised Learning

**Project title:** Unsupervised Learning \
**Author:** Paulina Pérez Garcés \
**Date:** September / October 2023

**Description:** \
This project's aim is to test out multiple unsupervised learning algorithms, some made up by the students from the Artificial Intelligence class and some well known clustering algortihms.

**Contents:**
* main.py: Connects all functions and runs the project
* data.py: Includes all functions that relate to the importing, preprocessin, characterization, and saving of data files and results
* algorithms.py: Includes functions for all clustering algorithms studied within the project.
* distances.py: Includes all functions that relate to calculation, application, and graphing of the norms used
* requirements.txt: List of all necessary libraries for the project

**Requirements:** For this project one only needs to run the file "main.py" which will call functions from all other files. Results will be saved in the results subfolder with the timestamp of the run. A few questions are asked for the user to be answered through the terminal. 

**Final report:** The final report for this project can be found in https://www.overleaf.com/read/kwgkqgrvtnzn#19403a

**Results:** Results can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uZ4mEZzlJMnU4SVXZixKVlAFk-tYFnAl?usp=share_link
